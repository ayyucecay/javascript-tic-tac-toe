# ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project is a tic tac toe game. Two people are played. In the game, one of the parties chooses the X sign and the other chooses the letter O. In turn, the parties try to win the game by placing their marks. If one of the players lines up his three pieces vertically, horizontally or diagonally, that player is the winner of the game.
